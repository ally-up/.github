## About The Project

The aim of Ally Up is 
* to [crawl websites](https://github.com/ally-up/ally-up-search-engine-crawler) for upcoming events
* let an editorial office update and add events
* to [provide a meta search engine](https://github.com/ally-up/ally-up-search-engine-ng) to find events

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) to implement web crawlers
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to allow for manual update of content
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store event data
* [Angular](https://firebase.google.com/) to display events

## Roadmap
